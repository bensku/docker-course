All buttons are already functional in exercise 2.8. I followed
READMEs of frontend and backend and set API_URL and BACK_URL correctly
in docker-compose file.

I could have set the variables in Dockerfiles, but since URLs are very
deployment-specific I don't think it would have made sense. Original
Dockerfiles from part1 exercises 10 and 11 are still up to date.
