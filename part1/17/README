I've built a Docker image that contains latest Lua (5.4.2) and a few commonly
used libraries. It is based on Alpine and weighs less than 10 mb!

The image has 'lua' as default command, but entrypoint is left unchanged to
allow easy access to other commands (e.g. 'luac' for precompilation).

Included libraries are:
* lua-cjson (JSON support; old version due to a bug in latest release)
* LuaFileSystem (file system access beyond what ANSI C offers)
* LuaSocket (TCP/UDP sockets)
* LuaSec (SSL support, mainly for sockets)

The image is available as https://hub.docker.com/r/hybensku/lua-demo.

Command to run a Lua REPL with all libraries available:
docker run -it --rm hybensku/lua-demo
