docker run -it ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

Do NOT give a website, curl needs to be installed. In different terminal, do
docker attach -it <name> bash
apt update
apt install curl

Then you can go back, give a website and it works
