Before building frontend/backend, remember to clone the
corresponding Git repository. This is just like part1/10,11.

https://github.com/docker-hy/frontend-example-docker
https://github.com/docker-hy/backend-example-docker

Both frontend and backend are executed as uid/gid 5050:5050.
For backend, ensure that logs.txt is writable for uid 5050
by e.g. chown 5050 logs.txt.
